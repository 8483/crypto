# Wallet

Anyone can create a wallet i.e. a public/private key pair (asymmetric encryption). You can derive the public key from the private, but not the reverse. Wallets can be created offline, and then accessed later with the private key.

**Public key** = wallet address = bank account number  
**Private key** = proof of ownership

The blockchain only holds wallet transactions, it does not have all the wallets in existence, thus, wallets don't "exist" until they are written on the blockchain.

You can transfer coins to a wallet that doesn't exist, i.e. destroying them, unless someone can generate the private key for the wallet.

Wallets can be:

-   hot (app) least secure
-   cold (hardware)
-   paper (offline) most secure

Ex. Paper wallet:

1. Create public/private keys offline
2. Print them out
3. Destroy digital keys
4. Add coins to wallet i.e. public key

# Other

coinbase = FIAT to crypto exchange

The bought crypto sits in the exchange, similar to money in a bank.

You can move the crypto to a wallet.

Bitcoin uses proof of work i.e. you get transaction verification based on spent electricity.
Ethereum uses proof of stake i.e. you get transaction verification based on risked stake.
